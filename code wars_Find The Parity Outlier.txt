instruction:

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers.
The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this outlier N.

decision:

def find_outlier(mass):
      chetn =0
      nechetn = 0
      for i in range(len(mass)):
          if mass[i] % 2 ==0:
             chetn = chetn+1
          else:
             nechetn=nechetn+1
      if chetn>nechetn:
         for i in range(len(mass)):
          if mass[i]%2 != 0:
             return mass[i]
      else:
         for i in range(len(mass)):
          if mass[i]%2 == 0:
             return mass[i]
