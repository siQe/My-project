instruction:

A Narcissistic Number is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, 
we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits):



decision:
 
def narcissistic(value):
    c = str(value)
    x = list(c)
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(x)):
        result = result + int(x[i])**len(x)

    if result==value:
        return True
    else:
        return False
